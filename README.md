Project Title: Panda E-commerce Sales Dashboard (Power BI Project)

Description:
In this project, I built an interactive and visually appealing Power BI dashboard to analyze the sales, profit, and quantity metrics of an e-commerce platform named "Panda."

It helps businesses track their performance and make data-driven decisions.
